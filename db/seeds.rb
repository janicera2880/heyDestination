Standing at the end of the bridge gives one the impression of soaring above the jungle and the ocean. The bridge points to where the sun dips below the ocean horizon each evening, making the end of the bridge the best location for cocktail hour. The bridge also provides shade for part of the deck and the large outdoor dining table.",
